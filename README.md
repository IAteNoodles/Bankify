# Banking_API
A Banking Management System written in python.

# Software used
1. Python 3.10.2 (A high-level easy to use scripting language)
2. 15.1 Distrib 10.6.5-MariaDB (An open-source fork of MySQL with additional features)
3. Visual Studio Code (A proprietary text editor by Microsoft) #Check VSCodium
4. Neofetch (An open-source text editor, fork of VIM)
5. DBeaver 21.3.3.202201242151 (Free and open-source multi-platform database tool)
6. Git (Git is a free and open source distributed version control system)
7. fish - the friendly interactive shell (An open-source shell with smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux with autocompletion, and many more useful features)
8. MyCLI (An open-source Terminal Client for MySQL with AutoCompletion and Syntax Highlighting)

# Services used
1. Github
2. Tabnine Autocomplete
3. Github Copilot

# Modules used
1. hashlib for sha3_512 (Used to store passwords)
2. mariadb (A connector for mariadb written in C)
3. pycryptodome for Public and Private key generation.

# Working
This project is basically a bunch of APIs linked with one another to make a BARE-BONE Banking Management System.
The APIs are:
1. People.py: For inserting People into the database.
2. Staffs.py: Contains the APIs needed for Auth and managing the database.
3. Accounts.py: Contains the APIs for changing the state of an account.
4. Users.py: Contains the APIs for the user to interact with his/her account.

CLI.py is the interface which binds all the other APIs into a working program.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.6 (mariadb module doesn't support any lower version of python)
2. Mariadb (RDBMS used instead of MySQL)

# Hardware used during production:
Many different systems were used in the production, but most of the code was written on my machine with the following specs.

  1. OS: Arch Linux x86_64   
  2. Kernel: 5.16.7-arch1-1 
  3. Shell: fish 3.3.1 
  4. CPU: Intel Pentium N3540 (4) @ 2.665GHz 
  5. GPU: Intel Atom Processor Z36xxx/Z37xxx Series Graphics & Display 
  6. Memory: 3811MiB

NOTE: These specs are not necessary for the working for the APIs.

# How to use.
1. Install Python 
2. Install Mariadb
3. Install the required modules using requirements.txt
   `python3 -m pip -r requirements.txt`
4. Clone the repository and cd into it.
5. Run the `Start.py` script to initialize the database and create dummy tables.
6. Test the project by running the script `test.py`
7. Relaunch `Start.py` after running `test.py` as the script will truncate all the existing tables.
8. Run `python3 CLI.py` in the terminal.

# Note

Details of the dummy users are stored in config/people_date.txt

# Contribution
I am really grateful to everyone who has contributed in any of the above specified projects, without any one of them this entire project would be much harder to made and test.
